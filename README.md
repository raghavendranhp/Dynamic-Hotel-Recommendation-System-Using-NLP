# Dynamic-Hotel-Recommendation-System-Using-NLP

## Overview

This project implements a Hotel Recommendation System using Machine Learning techniques. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) and collaborative filtering to recommend hotels based on user preferences and descriptions.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/raghavendranhp/Dynamic-Hotel-Recommendation-System-Using-NLP.git
cd hotel-recommendation-system
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The project is structured as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset (Hotel_Reviews.csv)(splitted file).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and model development.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing and recommendation algorithm.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project.



## Data Preprocessing

We use NLTK for natural language processing and Pandas for data manipulation. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features and create a user-hotel interaction matrix.

## Recommendation Algorithm

The recommendation algorithm is based on collaborative filtering and NLP. It calculates the similarity between user descriptions and hotel tags to provide personalized recommendations.

## Example Usage

To use the recommendation system:

```python
from recommendation_system import recommend_hotel

# Example: recommend a hotel for a user in Italy with the description "Business trip"
recommendations = recommend_hotel('Italy', 'Business trip')
print(recommendations)
```
